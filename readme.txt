Provides an easy to use interface to assign colors to any term from any taxonomy.

== Description ==
Provides an easy to use interface to assign colors to any term from any taxonomy. Then you can use them on front-end
using the built-in CSS class or just by calling `get_term_meta`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I have to place some code in my theme? =
No or maybe yes. You can use the plugin as it is, just to differentiate terms by color. However, if you want to display
the colors on the front-end, you may need to use the CSS class, that is something like `.ztc-term-label-{ID}`,
or directly `get_term_meta` to retrieve the meta value.

= I want to display the terms on front end how to do it? =
The easiest way is to use the built-in function that comes with this plugin:
```
ztc_colored_labels( $taxonomy, $post_id = false, $links = false, $limit = false );
```
